My name is Mehdi and I started this journey to have a bigger impact on humanity. If I can help ease up a process or solve an issue, I would love to work with you. 
I'm an Experienced Machine Learning Engineer with proven success in building successful algorithms and predictive models for different industries. Highly adept at regression and classification, data analysis and visualization to increase business efficiency. I'm into Random Forests, Natural Language Processing, Data wrangling and Exploration. I also really like predicting things that relate to the Ocean and environment when I can, when I can't you'll find me predicting chrun, life time values or sentiment analysis.  

Travel, Cultures, Food, Openmindness, Apadtability and Music are life's best offering in my opinion! Also Python, Panadas, Fastai and Scikit-learn are mostly all you need to do great things.
### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://https://www.instagram.com/p/Bnj5FuDA-YE/) and it will answer **all** your questions.
