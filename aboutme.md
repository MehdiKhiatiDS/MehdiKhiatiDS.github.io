---

My name is Mehdi and I started this journey to have a bigger impact on humanity. If I can help ease up a process or solve an issue, I would love to work with you. 
I'm an Experienced Machine Learning Engineer with proven success in building successful algorithms and predictive models for different industries. Highly adept at regression and classification, data analysis and visualization to increase business efficiency. By descanding order I prefer: Tree based models, Natural Language Processing, Data wrangling and Exploration, Making sense of data and Image Recognition. I also really like predicting things that relate to the Ocean and environment or Marketing related business decison making models such as predicting churn, life time values, sentiment analysis or image recongintion.

Travel, Cultures, Food, Ocean, Openmindness, Apadtability and Music are life's best offerings in my opinion! Also Python, Panadas, Fastai and Scikit-learn are mostly all you need to do great things in a data science world.

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you watch [my movie](http://https://www.instagram.com/p/Bnj5FuDA-YE/) and it will answer **all** your questions.
