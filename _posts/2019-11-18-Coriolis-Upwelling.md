title: You Don't like cold water don't you!
subtitle: Coriolis & Upwelling effect simplified

---

In some coastal areas of the ocean and large lakes, the combination of persistent winds and Earth's rotation (the Coriolis effect). Because of this rotation, winds tend to veer right in the northern hemisphere and left in the southern hemisphere while restrictions on lateral movements of water caused by shorelines and shallow bottoms induces upward and downward water movements, allowing upwelling of deeper, colder, full of nutrition water which is responsible for couple amazing phenomenon, We and marine life see and feel on a daily basis!

Whille all of this is fascinating, The trick is I wanted to use data science to do this project where I'll try and simplify this active movements happening in our environment and showcase it to you, then use and train the data to do predictive machine learning like predicting water temperatures, steepness of waves, best fishing season, water quality and in couple iteration, with more model training, ultimately try to solve few problems of ocean pollution and spread awareness about what we could do to minimize the damage while finding ways ustilizing this winds, to maybe slowdown global warming while knowing some what exactly where and when the perfect surf is happening! 

Using facets grip from Seaborn, I plotted wind direction correlating with water temperature as we see the more the winds tends to gust from the north the water get chillier and more nutritious.

Here is theccode for the Facet Plot:

```javascript
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.set(style="ticks")

# Pulling Upwelling dataset we created fron NOAA and UCSD databases

#df = pd.DataFrame(np.c_[upwelling['Water temperature'], upwelling['Month'], upwelling['Wind Direction coordinates']],
                  columns=["Water temperature", "Month", "Wind Direction coordinates"])

# Initialize a grid of plots with an Axes for each Month
grid = sns.FacetGrid(df, col="Month", hue="Month", palette="tab20c",
                     col_wrap=4, height=5)

# Draw a horizontal line to show the starting point
grid.map(plt.axhline, y=0, ls=":", c=".5")

# Draw a line plot to show the coordinate
grid.map(plt.plot, "Water temperature", "Wind Direction coordinates", marker="o")

# Adjust the tick positions and labels
grid.set(xticks=np.arange(0,30,2), yticks=['NE', 'NNE', 'SE', 'SSE', 'SSW', 'SW', 'NW', 'NNW'],
         xlim=(0, 30), ylim=('NE', 'SW'))

# Adjust the arrangement of the plots
grid.fig.tight_layout(w_pad=1)
```
During this bolg post I will focus on communicating my findings through visualizations generated by Seaborn and Matplotlib Libraries. But if you're interested in the data research, gathering, exploration and cleaning with Python and Pandas, I will link my jupyter notebook & github with all the code, functions and methods steps by steps!

 While the EDA step would evovle with time, newer data comes in. I will be doing statistically testing hypothesis.
