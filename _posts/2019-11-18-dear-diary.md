title: Coriolis effect simplified!
---

In some coastal areas of the ocean (and large lakes such as the North American Great Lakes), the combination of persistent winds, Earth's rotation (the Coriolis effect), and restrictions on lateral movements of water caused by shorelines and shallow bottoms induces upward and downward water movements, Which is responsible for couple amazing phenomenon we and marine life  see and feel on a daily basis! 
Upwelling is a process caused by winds which usually comes from the North during the Winter at the pacific that creates currents that bring deep, cold water to the surface of the ocean. 

The Earth rotates on its axis from west to east. Because of this rotation, winds tend to veer right in the northern hemisphere and left in the southern hemisphere. This is known as the Coriolis effect and is largely responsible for upwelling in coastal regions.

The Coriolis effect also causes upwelling in the open ocean near the Equator. Trade winds at the Equator blow surface water both north and south, allowing upwelling of deeper water.

The wind patterns generated during slow-moving cyclones can also blow surface water aside, causing upwelling directly beneath the eye of the cyclone. The colder water eventually helps to weaken the cyclone.

The trick is I wanted to use data science skills to do this project where I'll try and simplify this active movements happening in our environment and showcase it to you, then use and train the data to do awesome machine learning like predicting water temperatures, steepness of waves and in couple iteration and with more model training, ultimately try to solve few problems of ocean pollution and spread awareness about what we could do to minimize the damage while finding ways to use this winds to maybe slowdown global warming!
