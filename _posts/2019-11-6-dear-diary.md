title: Coriolis effect simpified!
---

In some coastal areas of the ocean (and large lakes such as the North American Great Lakes), the combination of persistent winds, Earth's rotation (the Coriolis effect), and restrictions on lateral movements of water caused by shorelines and shallow bottoms induces upward and downward water movements, Which is responsible for couple amazing phenomenas we and marine life  see and feel on a daily basis!

The trick is I wanted to use data science skills to do this project where I'll try and simplify this cool movements happening in our environment and showcase it to you, then use and train the data to do awesome things like predict water temperatures, steepness of the waves and in couple iteration and with more model training and we will ultimately try to solve few problems of ocean pollution and spread awareness about what we could do to minimize the damage.
